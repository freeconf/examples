  Using the gNMIc client to connect to your application  
---

[gNMIc](https://gnmic.openconfig.net/) is a utility that can connect to any appliction that supports gNMI protocol including applications. See [how to add gNMI support to your application using the FreeCONF]({{< relref "../gnmi-server" >}}). `gnmic` is unique because you can use it from the terminal to diagnose issues or use it in production to [send metrics to InfluxDB, Prometheus, Kafka, NATS](https://gnmic.openconfig.net/user_guide/outputs/output_intro/).

Here are some working examples of using `gnmic` from terminal to connect to the car example application with gnmi server support added.

```bash
cd ./gnmi-server
go run .
```

## Running gnmic

First [Install the gNMIc](https://gnmic.openconfig.net/#installation) client executable.  Then, in a separate terminal, go to the directory containing gnmic commands.

```bash
cd openconfig-gnmi
```

[[ cp "test-commands.sh" ]]
